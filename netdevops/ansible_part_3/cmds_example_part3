# How to:
#
# Re-use the python virtual environment of Part_1 and Part_2
#
# Change directory and enter in Part_3
#     cd ../ansible_part_3/
#
# if you prefer to create a new virtual environment, simply do:
#    python3 -m venv venv
#    source venv/bin/activate
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
#
# Reserve the Sandbox "Cisco Modeling Labs Enterprise" in Networking Sandbox category
#
# In CML Sandbox, the topology changed a bit so I have edited the inventory file
# and the host_vars folder
#
#
# ALL the topology (interfaces, vPC, OSPF, etc) is already configured
# in this sandbox
# Running the ansible playbook the way it is, activate the feature mdp on IOS-XE
# Then, the rest fails
# I would have to re-think the topology and make my changes in a way to merge
# with the new CML topology
#
#
# No need to do this anymore:
#     cd virl_sbx_mgmt/
#     python virl_simulation_setup.py
# The network device in the topology are directly accessible by TELNET
#
# Run in the shell :
#   ansible-playbook network_deploy.yaml
#
#
#
